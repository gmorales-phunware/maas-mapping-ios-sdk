/**
 The `PWAnnotationView` class is responsible for presenting visual building annotations in a map view. Annotation views are loosely coupled to a corresponding building annotation object that corresponds to the `PWBuildingAnnotation` protocol. When an annotationâ€™s coordinate point is in the visible region, the map view asks its delegate to provide a corresponding annotation view. Annotation views may be recycled later and put into a reuse queue maintained by the map view.
