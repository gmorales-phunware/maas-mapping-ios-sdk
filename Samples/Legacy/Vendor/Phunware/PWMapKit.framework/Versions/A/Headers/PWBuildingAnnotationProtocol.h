/**
 This protocol is used to provide building annotation-related information to a map view. To use this protocol, adopt it in any custom objects that store or represent annotation data. Each object will then serve as the source of information about a single building annotation and provide critical information, such as the annotationâ€™s location on the map. Annotation objects do not provide the visual representation of the annotation but coordinate the creation of an appropriate `MKAnnotationView` object to handle the display in conjunction with the `PWMapView` delegate.
 
 This protocol inherits from `PWAnnotationProtocol`. Data for this annotation is provided by Phunware.
 
 @discussion Never add annotations conforming to this protocol to the map view using `-addAnnotation(s):`. Phunware internally manages building annotations so that they show and hide automatically at the appropriate zoom and floor levels.
