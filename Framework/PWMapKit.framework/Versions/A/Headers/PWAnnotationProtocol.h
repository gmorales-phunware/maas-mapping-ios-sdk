/**
 This protocol is used to provide annotation-related information to a map view. To use this protocol, adopt it in any custom objects that store or represent annotation data. Each object will then serve as the source of information about a single map annotation and provide critical information, such as the annotationâ€™s location on the map. Annotation objects do not provide the visual representation of the annotation but typically coordinate the creation of an appropriate `PWAnnotationView` object to handle the display in conjunction with the `PWMapView` delegate.
 
 An object that adopts this protocol must implement the `annotationID` and `floorID` properties.
